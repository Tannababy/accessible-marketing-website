##Description
In this week's challenge, we were tasked with assignment to refactor Horiseon the marketing company's website to make it more accessible in line with designated acceptance criteria.

##Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

##Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

##License
The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use https://choosealicense.com/

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

##Features
If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.
